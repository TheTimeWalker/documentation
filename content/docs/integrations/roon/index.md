<p style="font-weight: bold">This integration is currently unmaintained</p>

The original author left the project and the remaining development team doesn't have a Roon setup.
We are trying to keep the current plugin running as long as the YIO integration API permits, but things will most likely break in the future. There will be no new features or fixes.

Please contact us on GitHub, [YIO forum](https://community.yio-remote.com/) or [Discord](http://chat.yio-remote.com/) if you'd like to help out!

This integration hub is intended for control of **ROON servers** with the [**YIO remote**](https://github.com/YIO-Remote).
It is port of [Roonlabs Javascript API](https://github.com/RoonLabs) to Qt/C++.
The QtRoon\* part is also usable for other Qt/ROON integrations.

Discovery is not available until now, the port and IP address of the server must be configured.
Important: the entities friendly_name must be the name of the ROON instance:

Entity:

```json
 "media_player": [
    {
    "entity_id": "media_player.work",
    "friendly_name": "Arbeitsplatz",
    "integration": "roon",
    "type:": "speaker",
    "supported_features": []
    }
 ]
```

Integration :

```json
{
  "url": "ws://192.168.1.100:9100/api",
  "imageurl": "http://192.168.1.100:9100/api/image/",
  "friendly_name": "RIC's Roon Control",
  "id": "roon",
  "log": "info"
}
```

YioRoon.\* communicates with they YIO remote software. I made some (small) extensions to the media-player entity :

- Adding a property **browseItems**. It is a list of media entry objects containing  
   o Item_key key of the entry  
   o title  
   o sub_title  
   o image_url for albums, and artists, (accessing the ROON server)

- Adding a property **browseCmds**. Up to 3 commands which are currently use for 3 buttons on the head of the list.  
  Currently I work only with simulation maybe on the real YIO we need only the hardware buttons.  
  This commands are necessary as ROON provides several possible commands on the different hierarchy levels :  
   o Artist play tracks from this artists randomly  
   o Album play whole album immediately, add to queue  
   o Track play now, next, queue

- Adding a function **browse (cmd)**  
  cmd is any of the commands from browseCmds (TOP, BACK, PLAY, QUEUE) or the selected enries item_key.
