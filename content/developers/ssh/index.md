YIO-OS supports both SSH and SCP. SSH can be used to get a terminal on the remote while SCP can be used to transfer files from and to the remote.

Depending on the OS your computer is running you might need a SSH or SCP client.

On the remote under settings you'll find its IP address. You can use it to connect.
