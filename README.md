# YIO Documentation

This is the source for the [YIO documentation](https://timewalker.github.io/docuemntation).

## Setup

For an easy installation, install node.js (preferably LTS) and run:
`npm install``

This installs all the necessary depedencies Hugo and Doks.
You can also run Hugo with the standalone binary but this is currently untested.

## Developing

Start the server by running:
`npm run start`

You can see the documentation running at `http://localhost:1313`

Any changes you make will immediately reload the page with the latest changes.

## Contributing

To contribute, first check your files by running `npm run lint:markdown`.
If there are no errors, you can create a pull request as usual.
